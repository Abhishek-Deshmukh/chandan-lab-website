      title="Importance of the crosstalk between TRP channels and cytoskeleton in chronification of pain."
      description="Recent results suggest that different cytoskeleton as well as multiple receptors recognizing several noxious stimuli contribute to the pain signaling. Several key molecular factors which are involved in acute and chronic pain have been identified. Among those, TRPV receptors (TRPV1-6) are important as these receptors act as non-selective cation channels and recognize several stimuli, and integrate extracellular as well as intracellular signaling events. Interestingly, involvement of microtubule cytoskeleton in the chronification of pain has been speculated for a long time. We are the first one to demonstrate the physical interaction between TRPV channels with microtubule cytoskeleton and functional relevence of such cross-talk in the context of different cellular functions."

      title="Importance of TRP channels as a sub-membranous signalling scaffold."
      description=" Taxol®, a microtubule stabilizer, often used as a chemotherapeutic drug in the treatment of cancer and AIDS is known to induce severe and chronic neuropathic pain. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of Taxol®-induced strong chronic pain is currently not known. TRP ion channels act as a molecular scaffold at the sub-membranous region, interact with different cellular components including microtubule cytoskeleton and contribute to different pain signaling. Among all channels, we are interested to elucidate the role of thermo-sensitive ion channels, namely TRPV channels (TRPV1-6), TRPM8 and TRPA1 in the context of Calcium ion-dependent as well as Calcium ion-independent signaling and further cytoskeletal reorganization. Such understanding has importance in the context to chemotherapy-induced chronifiction of pain."

      title="Regulation of vesicular recycling by TRP channels."
      description=" Receptor-mediated uptake, exocytosis, endocytosis, vesicle trafficking and recycling are complex cellular events which control several cellular functions. For neurons, such functions in turn control synaptic functions, release and/or uptake of specific neurotransmitters. Regulation of vesicular recycling also regulates the neuronal structures and connectivity. Interestingly, different thermosensitive TRP channels regulate these aspects in a very specific and unique manner. Using high-end imaging techniques we characterize these TRP-mediated vesicular recycling and membrane organization. Such understandings have broad importance in different neuronal as well as non-neuronal systems and have immense implications to dissect pathophysiological disorder at the cellular and molecular levels.

      title="TRPV-mediated channelopathy"
      description="Rare yet naturally occurring mutations in TRPV channels are known to induce several critical pathophysiological disorders due to altered channel function, regulation and/or distribution. For example, mutations in TRPV4 lead to development of CMT2 disease and other mascular dystrophies. Similarly, mutations in TRPV3 lead to “Olmsted Syndrome”. Such mutations alter channels' structure-function relationship and affect cellular functions largely. We aim to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms that go wrong in such cases."

      title="Importance of TRP channels in reproduction"
      description="TRP channels are present in several parts of the reproductive tissues including mature male gametes. In sperm cells, thermosensitive TRP channels seem to play diverse and complex functions such as thermosensation, Calcium signaling, capacitation, acrosomal reaction, regulation of sperm motility and fertility. We explore these functions in details. Such understandings will have both clinical and commercial importance in future as well."

      title="TRP channels in immune functions."
      description="Immune activation is a temperature dependent event and also needs massive Calcium influx. Indeed, so far several reports have suggested that TRP channels are present in the immune cells where diverse immune functions are regulated by this group of proteins. We investigate the importance of thermosensitive TRP ion channels in mammalian immune systems."

      title="Molecular Evolution of TRP channels"
      description="Genes coding for TRP channels are present in fungus to human (but so far have not been identified in plants). In all these species, TRP channels mainly act as a set of molecular tools required for different “sensory” functions. Over millions of years, such functions in turn play crucial role in the adaptation, ecological niche formation, speciation and also in evolution. Analyzing the sequences of TRP channels from different species provides useful information regarding the selection pressure and the molecular evolution of these channels. Such in silico analysis helped us to identify certain hidden motifs and characterize such motifs in details, which provides useful information regarding the molecular mechanism of these channels per se."
